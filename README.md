# JupyterCodes

The main purpose of this repository is to share my codes that I created for my university courses (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia). This codes are usually on jupyter. The main topics of this codes are about mechanics, electromagnetism and waves e.g., parabolic shots, average velocities, equipotential lines of an electric charge distribution, rotating vectors, data analysis, and curve fits.

In this repository you will find:

+ Intro Computational physiscs (Project of black body radiation)
+ Lab 1 Mechanics (Lab projects)
+ Lab 2 Electromagnetism (Lab projects)
+ Lab 3 Waves (Lab projects)
+ Mathematical Methods 2 (project of the discrete Fourier Transform DFT)
